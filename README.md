## Introduction

In the past few years, computer vision in image processing area has made significant 
progress, like image classification and object detection. Benefiting from the advances of image 
classification and object detection, it becomes possible to automatically generate one or more 
sentences to understand the visual content of an image, which is the problem known as Image 
Captioning. Generating complete and natural image descriptions automatically has large 
potential effects, such as titles attached to news images, descriptions associated with medical 
images, text-based image retrieval, information accessed for blind users, human-robot 
interaction. These applications in image captioning have important theoretical and practical 
research value. 
Image captioning is a more complicated but meaningful task in the age of artificial 
intelligence. Given a new image, an image captioning algorithm should output a description 
about this image at a semantic level. In this an Image caption generator, Basis on our provided 
or uploaded image file It will generate the caption from trained model which is trained using 
algorithms and on large dataset. The main idea behind this is that users will get automated 
captions when we use or implement it on social media or on any applications.
